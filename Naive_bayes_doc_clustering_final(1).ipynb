Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \\ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \\n\\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \\ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \\ndiseases via this route...so it\\'s good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \\nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \\nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \\ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \\nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \\nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \\npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \\nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \\nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \\nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \\nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \\nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \\nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \\ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \\npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \\nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \\nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \\'cooties\\' that \\nhaven\\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \\non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \\n\\nOf course in TCM...the body\\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \\nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \\nsite.\\n\\n\\nWhile I\\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \\ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \\nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \\n\\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\\n                                                                                                    \\n  \\n',\n",

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\\n\\nCanadians: 400\\nAmericans: 100\\nEuropeans: 100\\n\\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\\n25 players on each of the 24 teams.

I am sick\\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let\\'s say, the\\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn\\'t it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\\nteams is getting worse as well. \\n\\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I\\'m not a\\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \\n\\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren\\'t even\\nbetter hockey players. It\\'s all hype. This \"European mystique\" is sickening,\\nbut until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue\\nto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.\\n\\n    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\\nonly getting worse.\\n\\n    I\\'m all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\\nand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\\n\\n    I just don\\'t want them on mine.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n-- \\nRichard J.

Simply because if they win that battle all the little\\nstate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,\\nmedicine, and most other questions.\\n\\n      Local government has not \"failed\" in that it hasn\\'t done what it\\nshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local\\ninterests who want localities to abide by their rules can\\'t get their\\nrules past the local government.  Thus, since they\\'ve got more clout,\\nonly in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because\\nit can impose its will on the lower.\\n\\n      I mean, let\\'s get real here.

And if\\nyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \"pork\" in that\\nstate.  And since industries can\\'t concentrate their political power\\nand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get\\nwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.\\n\\n       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \"buy off\"\\nstates, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.\\n\\n>|>       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,\\n>|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically\\n>|>wanted to avoid.

And c) you get the benefit of not imposing\\nnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out\\nwithout a national decision.

EDT\\n\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \\nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \\nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \\nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \\nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \\npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \\nthose who are here.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \\nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \\ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \\nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \\ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \\nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \\ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \\nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \\nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \\ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \\ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \\nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \\ntake us into the future.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \\nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \\nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \\nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \\nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \\njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \\ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \\nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \\ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \\nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \\nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \\non the right track.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \\nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \\nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \\npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \\nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \\nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \\nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \\nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \\n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \\nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \\nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \\nis learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \\nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \\nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \\nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \\npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \\nhere today.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \\neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \\nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \\nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \\nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \\nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \\njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \\ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \\nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \\npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \\nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \\nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \\nfor them to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \\nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \\nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \\nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \\nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \\nI have proposed to create jobs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \\nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \\nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \\npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \\ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \\npeople.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it is especially important for America for two \\nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \\naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \\ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \\neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \\nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \\nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \\nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \\nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \\nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \\norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \\nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \\nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \\ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \\nchance to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \\nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \\nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \\nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \\nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \\nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \\nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \\ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \\nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \\nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \\nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \\ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \\nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \\nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \\nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \\nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \\nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \\nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \\nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \\nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \\nsomething there for them to do?\\n\\n\\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \\nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \\nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \\nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \\nsector.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \\nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \\nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \\nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \\nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \\ncreated before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \\nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \\nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \\nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \\na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \\npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \\nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \\njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \\nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \\ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \\neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \\nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \\npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \\nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \\nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \\ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \\nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \\nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \\nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\\n\\t     \\n\\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \\ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \\nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \\n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \\nthe environment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \\nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \\nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \\nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \\njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \\nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \\npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \\nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \\nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \\nhas never fully emphasized before.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \\nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \\ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \\ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \\nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \\nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \\nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \\nyear.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \\nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \\nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \\ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \\nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \\nenvironment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \\nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \\nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \\nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \\nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \\nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \\nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \\nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \\nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \\nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \\nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \\nthey earn, but letting them earn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \\nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \\ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \\nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \\nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \\nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \\nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \\nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \\nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \\nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \\nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \\nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \\nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \\nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \\nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \\nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \\nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \\nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \\nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \\nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \\nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \\nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \\nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \\nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \\nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \\nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \\nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \\ninvestments as well. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \\nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \\nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \\nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \\nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \\nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \\nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \\nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \\nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \\nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \\nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \\nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \\ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \\nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \\nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \\never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \\nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That does not mean young people should not be \\nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \\nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \\nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \\nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \\npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \\ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \\nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \\njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \\npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \\njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \\nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \\nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \\nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \\nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \\nyoung people want.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \\nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \\npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \\nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \\nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \\nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \\noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \\nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \\neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \\nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \\nkidding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \\ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \\ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \\nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \\ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \\nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \\nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \\ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \\ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \\nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \\neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \\nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \\nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \\nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \\nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \\neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \\nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \\nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \\nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \\nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \\nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \\nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \\npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \\nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \\nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \\nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \\nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \\nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \\nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \\nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\\n\\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

On\\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation\\'s\\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation\\'s\\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\\n\\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\\n      not barricaded or don\\'t have proper lighting.\\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\\n      levels of stress.\\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\\n      growing lack of support services for people who don\\'t have\\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\\n      The \"quality\" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\\n\\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\\nprotections for public employees.\\n   \"More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\\ncoverage for public employees,\" said McEntee.  \"This, despite the\\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.\"\\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\\nsevere.\\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\\nhave no OSHA coverage.\\n -30-\\n--\\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\\n416-629-7000/629-7044\\n',\n",

I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it.

He also KICKED John McLean. Of\\ncourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match\\npenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few\\nyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in\\nmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also\\nvery good.\\n\\nHow about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that\\ngoes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty?

You yourself mention \\nthat he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.\\nHe also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be\\nintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).\\nThis is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is\\ntreated as society\\'s intellectual lowest common denominator.\\n\\nI am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just\\nkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany\\'s problems and\\nneeded to be exterminated.\\n\\n\\n\\n>On Religion as the Basis of a Nation\\n>        Hitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \\n>inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \\n>decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \\n>culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \\n>sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \\n>expulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\\n\\nThis is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since\\nChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler\\'s characterization of\\nthe Aryan as \"the highest image of the Lord\" fits with Christian doctrine.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        Limbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \\n>But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \\n>ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \\n>charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \\n>for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \\n>American education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\\n\\nPrivate religious schools have a vastly better record of success than\\npublicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-\\nChristian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent\\nto Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching\\njust a wee bit here.\\n\\n\\n\\n>On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\\n>        Hitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \\n>One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \\n>theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \\n>Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \\n>must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \\n>service of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\\n\\nDefinite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment\\nindustry here.\\n\\n\\n>        Limbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \\n>Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \\n>who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \\n>and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\\n\\nJust a guess here, but I don\\'t think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate\\ngovernment control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show\\nto confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the\\ndepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control \\nof Hollywood.\\n\\n90\\'s Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control \\nof our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an\\nearly age the \"right\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. \\nLimbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \"young heads full\\nof mush\" hyperbole indicates.\\n\\n\\n\\n>On the News Meida\\n>        Hitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \\n>gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich.

Who \\nis being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?\\n\\nAgain, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would\\noppose government control of the media.\\n\\n\\n\\n>*     *     *\\n        \\n>To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \\n>ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\\n\\nIt is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.\\nLiberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people\\nwho disagree with them.

In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \\n>Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \\n>Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \\n>Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \\n>depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \\n>radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \\n>Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \\n>The Fascist States of America.\\n\\nPerhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve\\nRush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading\\nlaughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.\\n\\nAs to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.\\nMr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend\\nof government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism\\nin America through \"business/government partnership\" and increased levels\\nof taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes\\nin grade school.\\n\\n\\n\\n>        And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \\n>radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \\n>wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\\n\\nHmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler\\nbecause he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of\\nracism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to\\nracism; I don\\'t hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear \\nracism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal \\nLeft.\\n\\nThe Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked\\non the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized\\nEducation, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to \\nthat Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear\\nto me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush \\nLimbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than \\nthe other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.\\n\\n\\n>The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\\n>0845; (608) 255-4460.\\n>\\n>--- 30 ---\\n\\nThis is the same address as \"Idiots Anonymous\", isn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\nMatt Freivald\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLiBORGalism:\\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

Fante} \\\\endauthor\\n\\\\date {April 20, 1993} \\\\enddate\\n\\\\endtopmatter\\n\\nIn a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to\\npull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 day\\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\\nassigning blame.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\\n{\\\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\\n[Reno's] decision.''\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\\nto show their might and just purpose.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\\nBranch Davidians.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\\nand a city block razed.\\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\\\it This policy of no-knock\\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\\nand seizures''] are not denied.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\noindent Matthew L.

The trap is the easy way out.\\n\\tFor yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the\\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,\\nand much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You\\'re\\ngoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic\\ngroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors\\nleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than\\nnot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.\\n\\tIf, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few\\nBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you\\'d see the crime\\nstatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then\\nworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable\\nor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to\\ndefine \"us\" and \"other\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous\\nwhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational\\nhumans.\\n\\tIt\\'s interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the\\n*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don\\'t know the racial\\nmakeup of Phoenix, so I can\\'t speak to your situation. However, I live in\\nSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \"ethnic diversity\". Here, we\\nhave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \"model minority\") gangs,\\nand even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly\\ntroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their\\npropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on\\nthe street and they\\'ll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and\\ncrime are what they most fear. During the \"disturbance\" in Los Angeles last\\nyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I\\nremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs\\nwhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned\\nfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives\\nthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country\\'s first truly\\nmulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that\\nin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*\\nriot!\\n\\tIn closing, I\\'d like to say that you raise some interesting points\\nthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the\\nracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As\\na people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem\\nbecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly\\nbelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current\\ncourse of denial and repression.\\n\\tI wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,\\nluck in avoiding the \"trap\". \\n\\tPeace, my brother.\\n\\t\\t\\tm.\\n-- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHokh\\'Ton\\t:\\tThe Crystal Wind is the Storm,\\n  mdouglas@netcom.com\\t:\\t and the Storm is Data,\\nMichael Douglas-Llyr\\t:\\t  and the Data is Life.\\n\\t\\t\\t:\\t\\t---Player\\'s Litany (The Long Run)\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",

The only\\nthing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients\\nwith a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  And\\nthe \"private\" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient\\nthat it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every\\nother sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.\\n\\nOf the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health\\ncare costs last year, the Consumer\\'s Union estimated that at least 200 billion\\nwas thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and\\nprocedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.\\n\\nThere are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.

Here are some observations gained from\\npainful experience:\\n\\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\\n\\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\\n     that these things will itch for months.\\n\\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\\'s special\\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\\n     required to get it.\\n\\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\\'t work.  I recall\\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\\n\\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\\n     up on weekends since I literally can\\'t go outside where we\\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\\n     apparently don\\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\\n\\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\\'t tell you all the things I\\'ve tried.\\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\\n     it gains nothing).\\n\\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\\n     as well.\\n\\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\\ndoctors apparently don\\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\\nwould make a *lot* of money.\\n-- \\nGary H.

People were\\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\\nhours with some of the players. Here\\'s a game summary from the St. Louis\\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\\n\\nBy Dave Luecking\\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\\n\\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\\nJoseph.\"  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\\n\\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\\n\\nThe Blackhawks haven\\'t scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\\n\\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\\n\\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\\nBlackhawks couldn\\'t touch Joseph.\\n\\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \\nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\\n\\nThe Blues\\' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\\n\\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney\\'s first-period power play goal after two unwise\\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull\\'s goal in the second period, and\\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \\nperiod.\\n\\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \\n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four.\" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.\"\\n\\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There\\'s still one game left, but the Blues are\\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\\n\\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\\n\\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray\\'s decision to run into Joseph\\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\\n\\nThe Blues didn\\'t get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer\\'s shot and everything else Chicago threw\\nat him in the first period. The \\'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph\\'s butterfly\\nstyle is deadly.\\n\\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues\\' penalty killer twice stole the\\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\\n \\nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican\\'s third\\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\\nslashed Shanahan.\\n\\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull\\'s shot hit Belfour\\'s right\\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\\n\\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\\nshooting the puck into the Blues\\' bench.\\n\\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues\\'\\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt.

Does anone have any information\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\\n\\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\\n\\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\\n\\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\\n\\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\\nyears.\\n\\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\\nneuropsychologic tests.\\n\\nMy take on this (I\\'m sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\\nwithout PPS complaints).\\n---\\n .

The world now has almost 10\\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\\n  dramatically.\\n\\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\\n  of Seven nations.\\n\\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\\n  overall U.S. economy.\\n\\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\\n\\n    Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\\n  reduce demand.\\n\\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\\n  at the expense of the individual.\\n\\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\\n\\n\\n\\nAvailable from:\\n  Cato Institute\\n  224 Second Street SE\\n  Washington, DC  20003\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        The Cato Institute\\n\\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \\n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\\n    The Institute is named for Cato\\'s Letters, libertarian pamphlets\\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\\n  of the American Revolution.\\n    Despite the achievement of the nation\\'s Founders, today virtually\\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government\\'s arbitrary\\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\\n  civil liberties.\\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\\n  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,\\n  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from\\n  the sale of publications.

The better ones also include\\nadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to\\n \\nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\\n\\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don\\'t have to wait for your \\nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\\n\\n \\n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tBright Star\\n\\tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697\\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\\n    Description:\\n\\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \\n\\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations\\n\\ton posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best \\n\\twith sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible\\n\\tto record your own messages to warn of break.\\n \\n    Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tMedia Vision\\n\\tTel: +1 (510) 226 2563\\n    Platforms: PC\\n    Description:\\n\\tA sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.\\n\\tIncludes \\'At Your Service\\'.\\n \\n    Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tEscape Ergonomics, Inc\\n\\t1111 W. El Camino Real\\n\\tSuite 109\\n\\tMailstop 403\\n\\tSunnyvale, CA\\n\\tTel: +1 (408) 730 8410\\n    Platforms: DOS\\n    Description:\\n\\tAimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take\\n\\tbreaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or\\n\\tafter a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.\\n\\tIt gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from\\n\\ta set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work\\n\\tyou do - data entry, word processing, information processing.\\n\\tExercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on\\n\\thow to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.\\n\\n\\tCHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use \\n\\tto learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information\\n\\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\\n\\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\\n\\n\\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\\n\\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\\n\\tuseful when used with Windows.\\n\\n\\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\\n\\n    Comments:\\n\\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\\n\\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\\n\\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\\n\\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\\n\\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \\n\\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \\n\\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tRAN Enterprises\\n\\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\\n\\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\\n\\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\\n    Description:\\n\\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\\n\\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally\\n\\tdisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\\n\\tanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the\\n\\tcorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training \\n\\texercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions\\n\\tyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help \\n\\ton workplace ergonomics.  \\n\\n\\tQuote from their literature:\\n\\n\\t\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\\n\\tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\\n\\tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\\n\\tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\\n\\tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\\n\\thelp you to become more relaxed and productive.\"\\n \\n\\t\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\\n\\tGodnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup\\n\\tfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to\\n\\tpromote healthy and efficient computer use. \\n\\t\\n\\tCost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts\\n\\tfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).\\n \\n    Comments:\\n\\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\\n\\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\\n\\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\\n\\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\\n\\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\\n\\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\\n\\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\\n\\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\\n\\trequire any sound hardware.\\n\\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tVisionary Software\\n\\tP.O.

Warns you to take a break\\n\\twith dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises\\n\\tto do during breaks, and information on configuring your\\n\\tworkstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;\\n\\tquantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is\\n\\tbought in from another company, apparently; not sure how\\n\\tequivalent this is to the Mac version.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher \\n\\tMagazine (Feb 1991).

Its user interface\\n\\tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.\\n\\texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only\\n\\ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it\\n\\ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!\\n\\tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does \\n\\thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,\\n\\twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.\\n\\n    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\\n\\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar\\n    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)\\n    Description:\\n\\tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you\\n\\tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously\\n\\ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check\\n\\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\\n\\tcan start typing again.  \\n\\n\\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\\n\\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\\n\\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\\n\\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \\n\\n\\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\\n\\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\\n\\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \\n\\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \\n\\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\\n\\n\\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\\n\\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\\n\\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \\n\\tfeedback.\\n\\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\\n    Available from:\\n\\tVarious sources\\n    Platforms: Various\\n    Description:\\n\\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\\n\\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\\n\\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\\n\\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\\n\\tthe screen.\\n\\n\\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\\n\\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI\\'s \\'load=\\' line so\\n\\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\\n\\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\\n\\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\\n\\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\\n\\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \\n\\tfor the next appointment.\\n\\n\\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\\n\\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\\n\\tfile on your \\'run=\\' line, as above, and you will then, with\\n\\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\\n\\twith RSI exercises.\\n\\n\\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \\n\\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\\n\\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\\n\\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\\n\\n\\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \\n\\tyourself to take a break if you can\\'t get hold of a suitable RSI \\n\\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\\n\\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\\n\\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\\n\\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\\n    Available from:\\n\\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\\n    Description:\\n\\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\\n\\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\\n\\tmanually or automatically.  \\n\\n\\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\\n\\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\\n\\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\\n\\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\\n\\tare doing.\\n\\t\\n    Comments:\\n\\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\\n\\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\\n\\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\\n\\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\\n\\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\\n\\n\\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\\n\\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\\n\\twarning of the end of the time period!\\n\\n\\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \\nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \\nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\\nand may therefore make matters worse.\\n\\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\\n    Platforms: UNIX (don\\'t know which ones)\\n    Description:\\n\\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\\n\\tOnly works through tty\\'s (so, you can use it with a terminal or\\n\\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\\n\\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\\n\\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \\n    Description:\\n\\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\\n\\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\\n\\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \\n\\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \\n\\n-- \\nDan Wallach               \"One of the most attractive features of a Connection\\ndwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces\\nOffice#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet.\" -- CM Paris Ref.

Right?\\n\\nSteve I\\'m glad to see that you abandoned the preamble thing.  What; did\\nyou do a word search to find Welfare somewhere else in the constitution?\\n\\n[my comments and paraphrases in brackets]\\n\\nArticle I Section 8:  [in some ways the guts of the constitution]\\n\\nThe Congress shall have the Power:\\n\\n1. To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \\n       to pay the Debts [indebtedness as defined in the document]\\n       and provide for the common Defence [Defence as precisely defined]\\n       and general Welfare [as defined through the document, mostly in ways\\n                           [that limit the government.]\\n         of the United States; [but the above taxes shall be uniform through-\\n                               [out the U.S.]\\n\\n    [so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly]\\n\\n    [ then ... ]\\n\\n2.  To borrow Money [...]\\n3.  To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, [interstate and Indian tribes]\\n4.  To [do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies]\\n5.  To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and [etc.]\\n6.  To [punish counterfeiters]\\n7.  To establish Post Offices and post Roads\\n8.  To [provide patents and copyrights]\\n9.  To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;\\n10. To define and punish Piracies and [etc.]\\n11. To declare War, [and etc.]\\n12. To raise and support Armies,[but for no longer than two years at a stretch]\\n13. To provide and maintain a Navy, [notice no time limit on this one]\\n14. To [make the rules for the army and navy]\\n15. To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws [etc.]\\n16. To provide for [training of the army except for some state stuff]\\n17. To exercise exclusive Legislation [in D.C]\\n18. To make all Laws [necessary to execute the foregoing \"Powers\"].\\n\\nYour original instinct was right.  Looking to other nations for precedents\\nthat support an expansive liberal agenda is much easier than looking to the\\nslim pickins found in the constitution.\\n\\n-- \\nJim Albea                     jwalbea@jima.b17d.ingr.com\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Bob Rae, the\\nsecond least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if\\nthey didn\\'t stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, \"the services they\\nexpect from the province just won\\'t be there in a few years\" (Fortunately for\\nthem (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the \\nCanadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn\\'t say so, but I\\nknew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the \\ntruth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They\\'d be under no \\nobligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what\\nyou say is true, they\\'d be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling \\nsuch basic services, too).\\n\\n> \\n>>******************************************************************  \\n>>\\n>>WOULDN\\'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  \\n>>ACHE AND PAIN?  \\n>>\\n>>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  \\n>>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  \\n>>bills.  \\n>>\\n>>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor\\'s -- have a lower  \\n>>per-person health bill than we do.\\n> \\n>It is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\\n>things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\\n>real health insurance -- which actually it is).

Today he\\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\\nI'd never seen before.\\n\\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\\n\\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\\n\\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\\n\\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\\nand concerns me are:\\n\\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\\n\\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\\n\\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\\n    so.\\n\\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\\n\\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\\n\\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\\n\\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.\\n\\nAn amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was\\ndiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting\\na lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.\\nThis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.\\nThe guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\\nhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day\\nfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-\\nbroiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my\\nimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal\\nbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!\\n\",\n",

Apologies to those who\\'ve\\nseen the following before:]\\n\\nTo explain my position on the \"War On Drugs,\" I offer this:\\n\\nDrugs And Crime: A New Approach\\n\\nby Ken Barnes\\n\\n\\nGiven that:\\n\\n1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for \\nmuch of the crime which afflicts our nation.\\n\\n2. People who want drugs (particularly people who \\nare predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get \\nthem, whether or not they are legally available.\\n\\n3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs \\nare readily available to those who want them.\\n\\n4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is \\nresponsible for a significant drain on the productive \\nresources of our country, and this occurs in a variety \\nof ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are \\nunable to learn, to the spread of disease among \\naddicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse \\nand tobacco smoking.\\n\\n5. A general economic principle of government is \\nthat whatever is subsidized you get more of, and \\nwhatever is taxed you get less of.  To be most \\neffective in confronting the nation\\'s drug problem, \\nsome way must be found to utilize these additional \\npowers of government to make drug dealing and drug use \\nless attractive.\\n\\nWhile this country\\'s current efforts to combat \\nlegal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is \\na greater awareness of the health consequences of \\nsmoking, and designated-driver programs have helped \\nreduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be \\nsaid for the \"war\" on illegal drugs.  There remains a \\ncore group of illegal drug users which support \\ninternational networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, \\nprocessors, kingpins, and gangsters.  These networks \\nand their \"marketing activities,\" which include drive-\\nby shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, \\nand smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly \\nresponsible for a large proportion of the crimes \\ncommitted in our country every day.\\n\\nClearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are \\nlinked.  It takes only a moment\\'s reflection to \\nrecognize how they are linked.  The link is money.  As \\nwith this country\\'s failed effort to prohibit alcohol \\nconsumption, a black market has been created, in which \\ngreedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a \\nbygone era, have profited enormously from their \\nillegal trade.  The victims of this trade include not \\nonly the innocent people unfortunate enough to be \\ncaught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug \\nusers themselves.\\n\\nWere it not for the black market, and the violent \\nmonopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be \\nthe thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they \\nhave become in order to pay the high prices the drug \\nlords demand.  In the absence of the drug lords, most  \\nwould be, I believe, simply people with a problem, \\neither a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a \\ncriminal problem.\\n\\nLet me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that \\nwe let the criminals who have been preying on our \\nsociety for these many years of Prohibition off the \\nhook.  On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is \\none which would not result in either the government or \\nprivate industry getting into the business of \\npromoting crack cocaine, or any other presently \\nillegal drug for that matter.  Neither is it an \\napproach which sees law abiding citizens handing over \\nmore and more of their freedom and privacy in an \\neffort to track down illegal drug users, until \"the \\nland of the free and the home of the brave\" looks like \\na police state.\\n\\nHere then is my proposal:\\n\\n1. Possession and use of all presently illegal \\ndrugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them \\nremains illegal.  \\'Potheads\\' can grow their own \\nmarijuana (as many already do today), other drug users \\ncan legally import their poison of choice as long as \\nthey pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug \\nexperimenters develops.\\n\\n2. Because of the barter economy which supplies \\nthe drug users, the black market profits that have so \\nenriched the drug lords dwindle.  If these drugs can \\nbe obtained for \\'free\\' or next to nothing, why buy \\nthem?  Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek \\nto sell these \"noncommercial\" drugs even at relatively \\nlow prices.  Therefore,\\n\\n3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on \\nthose individuals who continue to buy and sell, and \\nalso on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to \\nafford even low prices.  But here is where the \\nstrategy begins to differentiate between the drug \\ndealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their \\nvictims.\\n\\n4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are \\npermitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a \\ndrug test.  Those who choose to cooperate are informed \\nthat upon conviction for the crime they are accused \\nof, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be \\ninstitutionalized until they are clean, and only then \\nwill they begin to serve their sentence.  If they \\nchoose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they \\ncan begin to serve their sentence right away.  Those \\nwho choose not to undergo the drug test and are \\nconvicted face stiffer fines and serve longer \\nsentences.\\n\\n5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals \\nserves several purposes:\\n\\nDrug using criminals (and this includes drunk \\nand/or \\'stoned\\' drivers) are separated from their \\nsources of supply, thus reducing the total number of \\ndrug users in society at large, and consequently \\ndecreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting \\nmore of the remaining drug dealers out of business.\\n\\nInstitutionalization provides an incentive for \\ndrug using criminals to straighten themselves out, \\nbefore becoming part of the general prison population.\\n\\nWhile helping protect society from crime, \\ninstitutionalization could also serve to deter drug \\nusers from becoming criminals, since drug using \\ncriminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed \\nprior to serving their sentences by the additional \\ntime it takes for them to sober up.\\n\\nInstitutionalization of drug using criminals \\nseparate from the general prison population would also \\nprovide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could \\nvolunteer for research studies of new techniques and \\ntreatments for addictive disease, with the potential \\nto benefit both themselves and others.\\n\\n6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not \\ndrug users themselves, and this is particularly true \\nof the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit \\norganizations.  Under this proposal, dealers would be \\nmore readily identifiable, since upon arrest they \\nwould presumably pass the drug test, or else decline \\nto take it in order to avoid having to explain why \\nthey are in possession of drugs when it is apparent \\nthey do not use them.  Declining to take the test, \\nthey would of course face stiffer penalties.  While \\neach case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug \\nwould have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of \\na suspect\\'s drug test could provide additional \\nevidence for the prosecution.\\n\\n7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to \\nthe decline of smoking in our country by making \\ncigarettes more costly while at the same time \\nproviding revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, \\nnoncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money \\ngenerated should be used to combat their use.  \\nEnforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis \\nhowever, and should not be used as an excuse to \\ninfringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial \\ndrug users, since to do so would have the effect of \\nreintroducing Prohibition.\\n\\nInstead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the \\ntax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever \\nfound in their possession during the course of routine \\npolice operations, they will be required to pay the \\ntax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to \\nbe destroyed.  If drug dealers are found to be selling \\nnoncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, \\nthey will face additional prosecution for evading the \\ntax.  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug \\ndealing charges is already in use in some \\njurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently \\nlimited by the illegality of drug possession.\\n\\nRevenue from drug possession taxes and import \\ntariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising \\ncampaigns, and provide support to private sector drug \\ntreatment programs for those unable to afford \\ntreatment.\\n\\n8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must \\nbe ended.  Federal support of tobacco farming is both \\nimmoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and \\nthe marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands \\nin many states must likewise be eliminated.\\n\\nWhile my proposal would have the effect of \\npermitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it \\nwould hold the users of all drugs responsible for \\ntheir actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm \\ndrugs have on our society, particularly the crime \\ncaused by the illegal drug trade.  So long as we \\nremain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, \\nand freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always \\nhave a drug problem.  Whether it takes the form of \\nheroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk \\ndrivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or \\nemphysema patients struggling for breath after a \\nlifetime of smoking, the results are the same: \\nneedless suffering and death.  As a society we must \\nrecognize that while our society permits us to harm \\nourselves with drugs, as we are already doing \\n(regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand \\nagainst the harm that drugs and drug users cause to \\nothers.  We must particularly oppose the vicious and \\nviolent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug \\nusers.  By taking the profits out of their deadly \\ntrade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting \\ndown these powerful criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe question of whether drug use is a moral or \\nmedical problem depends on which group of drug users \\nyou\\'re talking about.  Different drugs have different \\neffects, and some are more addictive than others.  The \\naddictiveness of a drug also often varies between \\nindividuals, and so we have some people who can drink \\nalcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot \\nresist the bottle.  Nicotine, which former Surgeon \\nGeneral C.

Such \"extra-\\n>rational\" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\\n\\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\\n\\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\\nlarge part of the history of science.\\n\\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\\n\\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\\n\\n(I wouldn\\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\\nI don\\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\\n\\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\\nfunction of science: results don\\'t count unless they can be replicated.\\n\\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\\n\\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\\'s irrational motivation had\\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\\n\\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\\nthink supports their position (creationists).\\n-- \\nMark A.

David Koresh has been arrested\\n?twice?  by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrant\\nand went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do they\\nchoose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under\\narrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building. \\n\\nIn addition, we KNOW that we\\'ve been lied to. Initially, we were told\\nthat they suspected him of molesting children and having several\\nwives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changed\\ntheir story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed.\\nAnd we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did\\nanyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire?

There\\'s a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which\\nkeep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING.\\n\\nOK.

The notion that coercion can\\nbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is\\neliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious \\nconsideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  \\n\\nFor example, does \"non-initiated force\" (coercion) include tax collection?\\nDoes it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned\\nby Adam Smith?

              " 'From: banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu\\nSubject: How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation\\nLines: 154\\nNntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu\\nOrganization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n\\nI got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \\nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \\ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \\nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\\'m going to state it again here.\\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \\nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\\n\\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \\nper day).\\n\\n\\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \\n\\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\\n\\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\\n\\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \\nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \\nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \\nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\\n\\n\\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \\n\\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\\n\\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \\n\\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\\n\\n\\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\\n\\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \\n\\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\\n\\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \\nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \\noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \\nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \\nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \\nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \\nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \\n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \\nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \\nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \\nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \\nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \\nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \\nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \\nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \\nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \\nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \\nbefore supplementation.\\n\\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \\nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\\'t know about \\nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \\nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \\nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \\nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \\nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \\nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \\ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \\nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \\nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \\nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \\nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \\nin urinary oxalate excretion.\\n\\n\\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\\n\\n\\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\\n\\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\\n\\n\\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \\n\\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\\n\\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\\n\\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \\nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \\nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \\nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \\nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\\'t \\nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \\nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \\nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \\n\\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \\nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \\nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \\nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \\neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \\nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \\nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \\nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \\nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \\nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \\ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \\nformation should be given B6 supplements.\\n\\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \\nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \\ncalcium-oxalate.\\n\\n\\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \\npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\\n\\n\\t5. \"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \\ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \\ninteraction\"J.

Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\\n\\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \\nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \\nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \\nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \\npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I \\nguess that he doesn\\'t read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney \\nstones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought \\nI\\'d tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor\\'s office.\\n\\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n1111 W. 17th Street\\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\\n\\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \\nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\".

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we do this on the lawn?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let\\'s go out \\nto the cherry blossoms.  We\\'ll do like the President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the stimulus package dead? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You \\nsaid it was a good visit, but no compromise.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \\nwith Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \\nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \\ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \\nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \\nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \\nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \\nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \\nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \\nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \\nabout that yesterday afternoon.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \\nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \\nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \\ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \\ncontinue to have some discussions.  And that\\'s where we are.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \\nboth making concessions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that it\\'s at that \\nphase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \\nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \\nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it\\'s going to \\ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he\\'s willing to \\nmake those adjustments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the subject of a VAT --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We have a problem with the five minutes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \\nlead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I\\'m not going to go \\ndown that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \\nthis morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \\nnumber of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \\nat.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \\nmade.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow, have they done that directly through \\nhim?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \\nabout it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \\nthere\\'s a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \\nVAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At the meetings that he\\'s had with his own task \\nforce advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \\npossible options would be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that that has been \\npresented for a decision, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \\noption?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \\nbriefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \\nPresident as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re not saying he didn\\'t know it was being \\nconsidered, though, are you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it\\'s being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He knew that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \\nThat\\'s what I\\'m asking.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it\\'s being \\nconsidered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \\nover the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \\ndon\\'t even know that it\\'s --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he didn\\'t say he was considering, did he, at \\nthis stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we\\'re \\ngetting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \\nconsidered -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven\\'t reviewed \\nit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \\nrepeated. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \\nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \\nit were to be considered he\\'d let us know, and having it trickle out \\nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \\ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think so.  I mean, it is \\nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \\nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \\nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \\ncome out not from you people, but --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \\nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What I\\'m saying is, though, that the President said \\nhe would let us know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \\nit\\'s not going to be on the program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On March 25th. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \\nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \\na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \\nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \\nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \\nClinton administration, the headline is -- I\\'ll look at it right \\nhere, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about his remark that if it were being \\nconsidered, he\\'d tell us about it?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration\\'s concerned, \\nand he\\'d let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \\nthis morning?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn\\'t have to be dragged out of \\nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \\nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \\nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \\norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \\nanswered the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re saying here that it didn\\'t have to be \\ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \\nconsidering it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \\nPainfully clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \\nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \\nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \\nanswered that it was being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, The New York Times --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why do it yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \\nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \\noranges numbers in order to portray last month\\'s unemployment figures \\nin a way that was supportive of the President\\'s job stimulus bill, \\nbut which turned out to be totally false.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if it was totally \\nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \\nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \\nsay that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \\nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what\\'s he \\ndoing about it, if so?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \\nmistake was made, it won\\'t happen again, and that\\'s the end of the \\nmatter.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t that the same information that goes to the \\nPresident?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There\\'s two separate pieces of \\ninformation.  I think that\\'s where the confusion was.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \\nthat was made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \\nThe New York Times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  Not to my knowledge.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \\nAnything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn\\'t.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wasn\\'t the President given an erroneous spin on \\nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I\\'m not sure.  Both \\nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \\nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \\nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn\\'t do it again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \\nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \\nwork, we\\'re gratified.  But that doesn\\'t take away from the need to \\nget this jobs package going.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \\nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \\namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \\nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \\nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \\nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there\\'s no \\nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don\\'t know that they discussed the \\ntiming like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you believe that you\\'re closer or getting closer \\nthis week than you were last week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we\\'re going \\nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \\nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don\\'t know where the \\nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don\\'t know what\\'s \\ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \\ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \\nhas changed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work on \\nit.  We\\'ll know when the votes are taken.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \\nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn\\'t go \\nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \\nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \\ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \\naccept.  This week you\\'re talking to him.  Is that because you\\'ve \\nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn\\'t going to work?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s because Senator Dole wanted \\nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He initiated the conversation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \\nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \\nsay he\\'s making --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that that\\'s exactly \\nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn\\'t have any indication that \\nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \\nand the President doesn\\'t want to compromise.  And the President \\ndoesn\\'t want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \\nit through, he will.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \\nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \\nthe actual vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when that will \\nhappen, but I think that it\\'s very possible that we\\'ll come forward \\nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \\nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \\npassed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \\nfirst one was some discussion of this and I\\'ll get back to you \\ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \\nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it\\'s a question of how \\ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \\npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \\nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \\nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \\nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \\ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we\\'ll let you know.  \\nAnd I\\'m not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \\nwe\\'ve talked about or that we\\'ve offered anything in a hard way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \\nPresident and Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \\nto talk to Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \\nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \\nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think it was a negotiation \\nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.  I know they \\ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \\nabout the programs they cared about.  I don\\'t know if they got to the \\nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \\nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \\nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \\nKohl or Feingold?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he\\'s talked to them, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is the President considering the more \\npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \\nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \\nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \\nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \\nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \\nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \\nquestion, I\\'ll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \\nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \\nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \\nnot true.  It\\'s actually waste water money.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s waste water money for \\nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \\nbecause it\\'s waste water money, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \\noverall. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the implication from your statement the other \\nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \\nWould you agree that\\'s not the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure of the specifics.  I \\nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \\nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \\non a VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when.  I just \\ndon\\'t know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \\nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So sometime since March 25th?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s right.  I don\\'t know \\nthe exact date.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \\nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \\nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \\nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \\nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he\\'s proposed, \\nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he\\'s already \\nproposed?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'ve said all we have to \\nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there\\'s just no -- this is \\nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \\nThe President hasn\\'t made any further decisions beyond that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn\\'t \\nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn\\'t replace the \\nincome tax, for instance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \\nSenator Dole\\'s press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \\nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \\nhave a chance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \\nforward?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \\nif the President were to decide to do it.  It\\'s not in consideration \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \\ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \\nconsideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \\nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \\nthat has to be considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \\nThat\\'s the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \\nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what he said. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \\ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to get into the \\ndeliberations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, George --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \\nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \\nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that the only thing that\\'s changed since his \\nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \\ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \\nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \\nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But this is the President\\'s knowledge that these \\ngroups had come forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \\nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \\npublished positions in the newspapers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group\\'s \\npresentations to them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve briefed him \\n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \\nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \\ngroups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \\nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \\nthat he had enunciated previously?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know, it\\'s just they\\'ve had \\nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \\nhealth care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The President wasn\\'t aware of those longstanding \\npositions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \\nObviously, he\\'s been a governor for a long time and he knows the \\nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What we\\'re trying to figure out here -- you\\'re \\ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \\nchange in the President\\'s attitude toward the VAT between February \\nand now --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President\\'s attitude hasn\\'t \\nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \\ntable.  So did you.  And you\\'re saying that the only thing that\\'s \\nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you\\'re also \\ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don\\'t see the change.  \\nIf these groups haven\\'t had any change in their position that\\'s been \\nmade to the President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they\\'ve made the \\npresentations to the health care task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s no relationship at all between the fact \\nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \\nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he ever suggested \\nthat they would produce all the revenue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \\nappropriate ways to finance health care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don\\'t know that \\nhe said anything to refute that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \\nthere wouldn\\'t be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \\nof core benefits --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t think that the task \\nforce ever suggested that there would.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \\nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \\nprograms?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t comment on a hypothetical \\nsituation.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \\nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \\nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \\non the VAT tax.  When he does, we\\'ll tell you and we\\'ll explain the \\nimplications then.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \\nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \\nforce has prompted this consideration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t have the specific.  I just \\ndon\\'t have that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \\nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \\nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \\noptions are?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \\nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \\nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \\nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not going to comment on \\nthem, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope of the need?  How much are you \\ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what the health care task \\nforce is looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since there\\'s not going to be any briefing on the \\nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \\nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \\ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \\nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does no mean yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes and no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know.  I saw the \\nPrime Minister\\'s press conference where he was asked the question \\nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \\nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \\ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \\nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \\nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \\nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \\nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \\nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \\nvery clearly.  I don\\'t necessarily want to agree with your \\ncharacterization of the Prime Minister\\'s comments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \\nnumerical targets -- is that what he\\'s going to discuss with \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re going to have a broad \\ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don\\'t want to get into \\nthose specifics until after the meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   That\\'s the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \\nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \\ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \\nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \\nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \\nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \\npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \\nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \\nMiyazawa himself, and then he\\'ll make the comment on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \\nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \\nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \\nmore, the Japanese saying that that\\'s not what they heard?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we\\'re going to continue to \\npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \\nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \\nwe\\'re going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \\npackages.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work \\nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \\nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher\\'s comments on \\nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It\\'s a rather emotional response.\"  \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \\nHouse condone that kind of remark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \\nChristopher\\'s remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \\nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we\\'re trying to find \\nanswers for. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \\nspecific term?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In connection with that, doesn\\'t it seem that with \\nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \\ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \\nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \\nair strikes, anything that can be done?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \\nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \\nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \\nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \\npressure at this time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \\nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \\nthe presidency?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re wrong.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor increased sanctions, and we\\'re talking to our allies about the \\narms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \\ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \\nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \\nchange your thinking?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we\\'re going to listen to \\nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \\nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \\nand talking about the arms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \\nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \\ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \\nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s exactly what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s true.  But \\nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \\nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \\nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \\nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \\nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \\nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \\neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \\ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \\nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don\\'t \\nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \\nall, I don\\'t know why they\\'d be fighting it so much.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are the First Lady\\'s tax returns going to be \\nreleased?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there\\'s a joint tax return.  \\nAnd it will be probably later today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \\norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \\nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think there\\'s any proposal \\nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s something that the President promised during \\nthe campaign that he would do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don\\'t \\nthink it\\'s anything that\\'s on his plate right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about on this issue.  \\nI assume that he\\'ll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \\ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \\ndifferent groups and communities.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if that\\'s scheduled --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s probably going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s a good thing you asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who\\'s probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How long --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  That\\'s all I know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if it\\'s at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know what time it is.  I \\ndon\\'t even know for sure if it\\'s going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \\nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve asked, but \\nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \\ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it\\'s not \\nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \\nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \\nthink the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \\nthat the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \\npoint out that he\\'s answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \\nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many questions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \\noccasions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many were while he was jogging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that\\'s actually a very \\ngood question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \\narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \\ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \\nHe\\'s had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \\nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \\nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s answered questions in the --\\nEast Room.  He\\'s had five in the East Room, he\\'s had one in the Oval \\nOffice, he\\'s had one in the Rose Garden, he\\'s had one or two in the \\nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \\nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he\\'s had 17 interviews with local \\ntelevision anchors.  He\\'s met with the editorial board of The \\nPortland Oregonian.  He\\'s had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \\nHe\\'s had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \\nConnecticut --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \\nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \\nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \\nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s had briefing memos.  He\\'s had \\ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \\nTrade Representative and others.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     report yet?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know that the \\nreport\\'s been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \\nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \\nthat there\\'s a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \\nfeels that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \\nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \\nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.

If this true then is it\\n# possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led\\n# to believe?\\n# \\n# Perhaps if Americans were more open about there sexuality---I think\\n# most Americans aren\\'t---then we might discover that there are really\\n# quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same\\n# sex---men and women included.  I\\'d venture a guess that there is a\\n# lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship\\n# with someone of the same sex at some point in there life.  Maybe they\\n# didn\\'t take their longings seriously, but this doesn\\'t make these\\n# longings any less valid.  Therefore, if Americans weren\\'t so\\n# repressed about their sexuality in general---as I believe they may be\\n# ---then we\\'d see a lot more people \"coming out of the closet\".\\n\\nYou mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to \\naccept a study (Kinsey\\'s) that is obviously wrong?  \\n\\n# As for myself, I\\'m a heterosexual and I\\'ve never considered having\\n# sex with another man.

I'm not sure if you meant to imply that or not, but I just thought\\n># I'd bring that up.\\n\\n>Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political\\n>party.  That's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system.\\n\\nYour statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the\\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\\nGerman voters.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\\nChancellor.\\n\\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\\n\\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\\nbegun to decline.\\n\\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\\nparties to work together.\\n\\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\\n\\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\\n\\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties\\n(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.\\nHitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see\\nthe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.\\n\\n-----\\nEric Smith\\nerics@netcom.com\\nerics@infoserv.com\\nCI$: 70262,3610\\n\\n\",\n",

Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so).\\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\\n\\nA couple misc notes:\\n\\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\\n\\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\\n\\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no\\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\\n\\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\\nexpected to be back next year.

He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.\\nIn both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres\\nthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of\\nhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. \\nEven in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to\\nindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been\\nfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)\\nthrough the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open\\nup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on\\na breakaway to salt away the game).  There\\nis no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the\\nvictory. \\n\\nIn my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as\\nLaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get\\nextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev\\n(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense\\n, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton\\nplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)\\nThe difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. \\n\\nGary\\n\\nGo Sabres!\\n\",\n",

Dr. Teperman \\ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \\nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \\nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \\ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \\na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \\nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \\nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \\nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \\nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \\ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \\nDr. Teperman. \\n\\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\\n\\n\\nLAST MEETING\\n\\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \\nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \\nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \\nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \\nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \\nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \\nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \\nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \\na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \\nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \\ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \\nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \\nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \\ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \\n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \\nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \\nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \\nher for an entertaining evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nANNUAL MEETING\\n\\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \\nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \\nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \\npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \\nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \\nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \\nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \\nslate for the Board.\\n\\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\\n\\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\\n\\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\\n\\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \\nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \\nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \\nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \\nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \\nmembers and there is plenty of work. \\n\\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \\ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \\nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\\n\\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \\nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\\n\\nFUTURE MEETINGS\\n\\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \\n\\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\\n\\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \\n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \\n\\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\\n\\nNOTDAW\\n\\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \\nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \\nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \\nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \\nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \\n\\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \\nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \\na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \\naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \\nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \\nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\\n\\nDR.

It\\nwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun\\ncontrol laws.\\n\\n       I think if we looked we\\'d find very specific (cultural and\\nenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then\\nthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.\\n\\n>Given that most\\n>criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who\\n>purchase them legally, having more restrictions on legal possession does \\n>seem to have the effect of reducing gun-related crimes.  \\n\\n       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished\\nbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a\\ncrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn\\'t address the\\nquestion of Canada.

The non-gun rates were roughly the same for both cities.  The\\n>difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun-related.  \\n\\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\\n\\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\\nsame conditions.\\n\\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\\nthen we\\'d expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\\nlower.\\n\\n>>  -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city\\n>\\n>Surprise.

As such  if there is a condition\\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\\nis the source of Canada\\'s low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada\\'s major gun control\\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\\nthey didn\\'t even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\\nthe early eighties.\\n\\n>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already\\n>\\n>Post hoc ergo propter hoc.  Those areas implemented gun control because of\\n>the high rates.  \\n\\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\\n\\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\\nviolent crime.  Since it\\'s gone up in those areas, often faster than it\\nwas going up before, you can\\'t simply dismiss the high crime rate by\\nsaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted\\nto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you\\ncan\\'t continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of\\nthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control\\nwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.\\n\\n>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.\\n\\n       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent\\nof gun control.\\n\\n>And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in \\n>Washington D.C. may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there.\\n\\n       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what\\nothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would\\nsell to them?\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \\nFamilies USA.\\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \\nthat doctors make too much money.\\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \\nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \\nOK.\\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \\nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \\nand are still simmering.\\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \\nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \\nof Americans don\\'t make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \\ndo are stealing it from them.\\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don\\'t  kid  yourself.  \\nKarl Marx lives.\\n     It\\'s also stupid because it didn\\'t ask key  questions,  such \\nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \\nbecome a physician?\\n     If those polled said no,  they didn\\'t know, then they should \\nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \\nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \\na doctor should earn if they don\\'t know what it takes to become a \\ndoctor?\\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \\nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \\ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \\nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \\ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \\nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \\nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \\nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \\n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \\nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \\ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \\ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \\nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \\nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \\nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \\nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \\ncalled together to remake America\\'s health care.\\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \\nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \\nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \\nto health what Clinton\\'s first budget is to frugality.\\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \\nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \\nmajor cause of high medical costs.\\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \\nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \\nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \\na McDonald\\'s?\\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \\na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \\ncabbages.\\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \\nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \\ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \\nthey might have been more honest if they had said:\\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \\nproblems we have.

Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \\nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \\nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \\nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \\n\\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \\nno idea how the human body interacts with it\\'s environment and how that \\nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \\nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \\nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \\nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \\nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn\\'t help Elaine or Jon\\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \\nquack.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \\nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \\nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \\nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \\nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \\nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \\neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \\naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\\'s use of vitamin \\nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.

It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\\n\\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\n\\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\\nhasn\\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\\nresearch then it can\\'t be of any interest to us.\"  \\n\\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There\\'ve got to\\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\\n\\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\\'s most \\nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \\nit doesn\\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \\nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \\nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\\nprocess doesn\\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\\'t need to\\npractice it over again at home.\\n\\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \\n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \\nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \\nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \\nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \\nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \\nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \\nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \\neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \\nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \\nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \\nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \\n\\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\nfrom scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \\npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don\\'t have any way of \\nknowing that it\\'s effective.\"  \\n\\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \\nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \\ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \\nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\\'s described in a number of \\nbooks and I\\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \\ndetail as I\\'m capable of.)  \\n\\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \\nfavorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because it\\'s a\\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \\nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \\nattitudes about science.  \\n\\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \\nIf so, I apologize. \\n \\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\\n             \\n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\\nfor over the life of our budget.\\n             \\n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\\n             \\n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\\n\\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The drug should not be used in women who have \\nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \\nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\\n\\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \\ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \\nosteoporosis.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S.

These findings, according to \\ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \\nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \\ncountries. \\n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \\nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \\n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\\n\\n Switzerland:\\n\\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\\n              31 Samuel Balmer\\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\\n \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\\n\\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\\n 3rd:\\n\\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\\n Attendance: 8,600\\n\\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\\n\\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\\n \\n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\\n\\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

How\\'s that for an answer?  :-)\\nSeriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you are\\ntalking about a governmental employer or not.  In this case, I\\nbelieve that there should be absolutely no discrimination,\\ndirect or indirect, period.  I feel this way not because it would\\noffend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), but\\nbecause the government is a coercive entity which we cannot\\nescape.  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were\\n\"whites only\" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountains\\nfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains\\ncertainly were not applied to \"whites only.\"  In essence, we\\ncannot escape the coercive state.  Even Randy Weavers have to pay\\nproperty tax.  On the other hand, private employers are not a\\nmonopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not by\\nthe government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over to\\nthat government.\\n\\n#> Why?

In Santa Cruz\\n(where a number of loony anti-discrimination laws exist),\\na guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had\\nevery imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe,\\nand his tatoos were very distracting.\\n\\n#> Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA.

If\\n> the landlord doesn\\'t associate with his tenants, then how can he complain\\n> that his FOA is being violated?\\n\\nI have a lot of interaction (all positive) with my tenants,\\nso I guess that that isn\\'t an issue.  But say I were to buy\\na unit in another town, and have it managed by a third party.\\nLet\\'s say that I have a real aversion to Christians because\\nof the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker, and\\nbecause of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected.\\nI don\\'t want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window\\nof a house that I own.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\\n\\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\\'re going to have a hard time finding\\n\\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\\n\\truns the X window system, you\\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\\n\\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\\n\\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\\n\\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\\n\\n\\tThe two main programs I\\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\\n\\n\\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\\n\\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\\n\\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\\n\\tserver can do this, run \\'xdpyinfo\\' and see if any of these strings\\n\\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\\'t have this,\\n\\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\\n\\tor bugging your vendor.\\n\\n\\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\\n\\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\n\\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n    2. X terminals\\n\\n\\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\\n\\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\\n\\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\\n\\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.

NeXT\\n\\n\\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\\n\\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\\n\\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\\n\\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\\n\\n    4. Silicon Graphics\\n\\n\\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\\n\\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\\'s not\\n\\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\\n\\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\\n\\tdetails.\\n\\n    5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\n\\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\\n\\tUnfortunately, you can\\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\\n\\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\\n\\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\\n\\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\\n\\tworks.  However, they don\\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\\'ve been  ||\\n\\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\\n\\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\\t\\t\\t\\t    ||\\n    \\n    6.

The owners put out a statement few days ago, \\nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \\nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \\nshould.

And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \\nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \\non the economic stimulus plan?

I \\nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \\nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \\nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \\nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \\nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \\ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \\nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \\nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \\npressure not to do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \\nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \\neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \\nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \\nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \\nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \\na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \\nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \\nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \\nlevel, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they \\nhave chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep \\nAmericans out of work.

ESPN had\\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\\nnight).\\n\\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They\\nmust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something\\nto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of\\ncontract with baseball.\\n\\nSo relax.

Very few human activities indeed\\nfit into this category.  \\n\\nEven for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement \\nof what is and is not a fully autonomous activity?  Who defines \"picking \\nmy pocket\" and \"defrauding\"?  Are economic assets a person\\'s only assets,\\nor are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child\\'s emotional \\nenvironment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person\\'s\\nassets?  What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a\\nparent strongly objects to?  What gives you the right to create an \\nenvironment of social unrest and instability?  If you say that what you\\ndo does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that?  Who\\nis empowered to make these value judgements?\\n\\n\\n>How \\n>would *you* feel if I got a gang together and found xtianity\\n>(or insert your favorite cause here) morally repugnant and\\n>passed laws to outlaw its free exercise? (all at a local\\n>level, since that seems to be A-OK with you)\\n>\\n\\nIf the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so, the \\nfederal government would prevent you from doing so.  If it did not, and\\nyou could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local\\nConstitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government \\nto do so, then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood\\nmore friendly to my own system of values.  This is not an ideal situation,\\nbut it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now.\\n\\n\\n>> As to the \"gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends\", there are very\\n>> few restrictive local laws that I personally would advocate or vote for,\\n>> since I am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors\\n>> should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary.

The debate is not whether you or a\\n>communitity would or would not vote away my rights; it is\\n>the propriety of whether that should even be an *option*.\\n\\nWhen you define \"rights\" very broadly, there is no practical choice about \\nwhether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these\\n\"rights\" overlap.  Even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government \\nhas been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights.  The \\nfundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created.  If you \\nsupport the current situation with a \"natural rights\" Supreme Court (rather\\nthan an \"original understanding\" Supreme Court or, even better, Supreme\\nCourt by Jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington, \\nD.C. create those powers out of the air.  In my \"Fractal Federalism\" scenario, \\nit is a broad consensus of The People (i.e. the amendment process) that \\ncreates those powers.\\n\\n\\n>> Certainly not the only cause, Mike, but people in a local neighborhood\\n>> should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood.

All the clamor \\nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \\ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \\ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \\ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \\nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \\nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \\nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \\nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \\nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \\nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \\nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \\nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \\npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \\nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \\nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \\nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \\nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \\nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \\nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \\ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \\nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\\n\\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \\na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \\nwarrented.\\n\\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \\nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \\nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \\ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \\nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \\nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \\nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \\nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \\nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \\nrestricting calcium intake.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \\nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn\\'t it make sense for humans \\nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \\nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \\nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \\ninfections should decline.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

We\\'re talking prudent policy in\\n>infant nutrition here, yet you\\'re misrepresenting it as received wisdom.\\n\\nWho said anything about \\'received wisdom\\'? There is no question that\\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \\n\\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It\\'s unethical to\\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\\nindustry knows this. That\\'s why the animal model is used in medicine\\nand psych.  If you\\'re talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\\nphysiology.\\n\\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \\n\\n>>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you\\n>>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles\\n>>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. \\n>\\n>You mean \"asserting\".

It says nothing about MSG\\'s contribtion to the phenomenon\\n>of the \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\".  It says nothing about the frequent\\n>inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.\\n\\nOlney\\'s work provides a putative causal mechanism for some\\nsensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally\\nadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone\\nfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant\\nsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient\\nrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is\\nresponsible not only for control of growth during development, but\\nalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of\\nheadaches?

It is interesting\\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\\nby the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\\nabsence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs\\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\\ncan\\'t find the patient\\'s heart sounds (because they\\'re on the wrong\\nside). \\n\\nAccording to Harrison\\'s, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\\nin a family would be affected.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\\n\\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\\n\\nJohn Sorenson\\nCarol Sigelman\\nCarla Moore\\nBarbara Moose\\nJudith Schrier\\n\\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\\n\\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \\nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \\nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\\n\\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nan Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  \\nWhile most of my faxes were received in \"standard\" mode (200x100 dpi), the \\naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. \\n\\nOverall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the \\nlimitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just \\ntoo small. \\n\\nIf anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n                         Emerging Infectious Diseases\\n                         ============================\\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\\n\\n                                 Introduction\\n\\n     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would \\nsoon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \\nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \\nthe United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

You should\\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \\n complex instead. If you don\\'t (and there are some exceptions to that)\\n you\\'ll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \\n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \\n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\\n\\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \\n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \\n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100\\'s) in one day\\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\\n  \\n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that\\'s why they can\\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\\n\\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \\n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\\n \\n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\\n are big, and they don\\'t taste that great), a product made from pine \\n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\\n The name for the pine bark product is \\'Pycnogenol.\\'\\n  \\n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\\n \\n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \\n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \\n\\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\\n \\n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\\n\\n   -- Ron Roth --\\n =====================================================================\\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\\n\\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.\\n---\\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363\\n',\n",

Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

How\\ndid your interviews go?\\n\\nAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted\\nme for anything.

PST\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \\non the aid package.\\n\\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \\nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \\nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \\nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \\n\\n\\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \\nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \\nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \\nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \\nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \\nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \\nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \\ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \\nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \\nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \\nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \\nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \\nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \\nsingle --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \\nsingle, individual dwellings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \\nserved by this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \\nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \\nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \\nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \\nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \\na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \\nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \\nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \\nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \\nyears from now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \\ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \\nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \\ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \\nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \\nfrom now to pay back those loans.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     substantial government-to-government loan \\nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \\nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \\non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \\nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \\njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     government loans in any other sector that \\nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \\nto say this is a new and unique effort.\\n\\n                               END10:25 A.M.

And in fact, because of the lack of \\na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \\nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \\ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.

Faced with situations in which the wrong has\\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\\nprefer).  In these cases, the \"sale\" has already taken place and is\\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\\n\\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\\npotential victim\\'s property rights are protected until and unless he\\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\\nparties themselves.\\n\\n>> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\n>> business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n>> (If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\n>> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n>\\n> Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.\\n\\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they\\'re simply a cost of doing business.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine\\'s Summer 1992 edition\\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\\nyou\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\\nfor the U.S.\\n\\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\\njust a few people have to be reminded that it\\'s not free (the average\\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\\ncounterparts on issues like these).\\n\\nI\\'m one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, \\'cos the 100%\\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn\\'t know\\nit, you\\'d believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren\\'t worried about the\\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we\\'re worried about the French and Germans\\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\\nshouldn\\'t be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn\\'t spiralled out of control despite\\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\\nspend all of your benefits\\' worth, and more if you can ... we\\'re a\\ndifferent culture.\\n\\n>Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two \\n>elements of the current health care system that reformers most often \\n>criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the \\n>employer-based system of coverage.

It is all pure insurance without HMO\\'s.  The divisions\\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\\n\\nWith such an open-ended system, it\\'s no surprise that Canada is #2 to\\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go.

At the same time a\\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\\n\\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\\'s navy cannot\\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\\nmatter how risky they may be.\\n\\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\\nmy friends, Her Majesty\\'s navy has sailed into a trap.\\n\\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\\'ve been hearing\\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\\n\\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\\nreign of England\\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \\nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\\'s\\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\\n\\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\\n\\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\\'s\\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\\nNavy.\\n\\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\\n\\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\\n\\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\\nthem.\\n\\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \\nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\\n\\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\\'s\\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\\'s\\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \\nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\\n\\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\\'s this\\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\\n\\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \\nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\\n\\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\\nnot Britain.\\n\\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\\'s\\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\\'s\\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\\nIsland at all?\\n\\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\\nenormous military secret.  It\\'s a giant underground installation\\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \\nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\\nI will describe shortly.\\n\\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\\nWashington.  For the past two months I\\'ve been reporting the\\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\\nand verify them.\\n\\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\\n\\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia\\'s new rulers in the Kremlin are\\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\\nthe world.\\n\\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\\nand Russia\\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\\n\\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \\nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\\nBrothers.\\n\\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \\nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \\nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\\n\\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\\nHemisphere war.\\n\\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\\nbut very little of the air changes places.\\n\\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \\nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \\nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\\nnatural resources.\\n\\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\\nNo. 36.\\n\\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\\nRockefellers.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\\ninherit the Earth.\\n\\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \\nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\\n\\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \\nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\\n\\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\\'s extreme\\nimportance in the coming war.\\n\\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\\ndown virtually to the water\\'s edge.  The other part of the\\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\\n\\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\\nPacific.\\n\\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \\nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \\nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \\nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\\n\\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\\'s. \\nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \\nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\\nappearance both during and after construction.\\n\\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\\n\\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\\'s McNamara\\npresided over the public paring back of America\\'s visible\\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\\n\\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\\ntechniques.\\n\\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\\n\\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\\n\\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\\n\\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\\ngenerates the field.\\n\\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\\nStates Military.  Now it\\'s the American Bolsheviks who are in\\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\\n\\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\\n\\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\\nWAR ONE.\\n\\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\\nWashington.  It\\'s a plan by which the United States will strike\\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\\nwith Russia.\\n\\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\\n\\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\\nfast running out.\\n\\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\\ncertain ways.\\n\\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\\n\\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \\nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\\n\\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\\n\\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\\nare known to be as I described last month.\\n\\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \\nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\\n\\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\\n\\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\\n\\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\\nalso its Achilles\\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\\n\\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\\ndo.\\n\\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\\n\\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\\nthe Argentine flag.\\n\\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\\n\\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\\'s point of\\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\\n\\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \\nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\\nwould be a nerve gas.\\n\\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\\ncontrolled.  That\\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\\n\\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\\ndoors would be suicide.\\n\\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \\nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\\npreparations.\\n\\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \\nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\\'s Foreign Minister,\\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \\nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\\ncertain officials.  He got them!\\n\\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \\nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\\n\\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\\nshambles of the plan.\\n\\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\\nknown, there were no survivors.\\n\\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\\nresults, both important:\\n\\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\\n\\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\\nNew Zealand!\\n\\n   The British ship\\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed by\\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \\nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\\n\\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\\nstill out of range.\\n\\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\\ntactics which the Russians employed.\\n\\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \\nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \\nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\\naround the world.\\n\\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \\nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\\n\\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\\n\\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\\nthere were a nuclear war.\\n\\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\\nmoney--and plenty of it.\\n\\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\\nmachine at work.  As I\\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefeller\\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\\n\\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\\nand Russia; but as Russia\\'s new rulers know very well, this does\\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\\nRockefeller group.  It\\'s purely a matter of practical necessity\\nright now for the Rockefellers.\\n\\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it\\'s scaring people. \\nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\\n\\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\\n\\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\\n\\n   Now it\\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\\'s Waterloo at sea\\nmay well be at hand.\\n\\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"\\n\\n   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,\\nand may God bless each and every one of you.\\x1a\\n',\n",

It *does*\\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\\n>which are not.)\\n\\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \\n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

I would appreciate any comments about this and other\\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\\n\\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\\nout in 'noisy' situations.\\n\\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\\n\\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\\noff a cliff).\\n\\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \\n\\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\\nUSA\\n\",\n",

We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \\n\\n                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Results of their research\\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\\nRadiology.\\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\\nfor Alzheimer\\'s disease calls for lengthy memory function and\\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\\n   In addition to Alzheimer\\'s disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease and Huntington\\'s\\ndisease.\\n   \"We\\'ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer\\'s earlier and\\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\\nwith Alzheimer\\'s showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer\\'s disease is widely\\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer\\'s is caused by an\\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer\\'s were based\\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\\nAlzheimer\\'s from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,\" said Bruce\\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\\nand a co-author of the study.\\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\\nand will be configured for other manufacturers\\' MRI units soon.\\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\\n\\n   Q & A on Alzheimer\\'s Disease:\\n\\n   What is Alzheimer\\'s disease and how is it caused?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\\n   How many people does it affect?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer\\'s\\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\\nemotionally and financially, for patients\\' families.  AD is the\\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\\nof Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree\" and\\nsuggests the following criteria:\\n\\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\\n      normal.\\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\\n\\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer\\'s disease and other forms\\nof dementia.\\n -30-\\n--\\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\\n416-629-7000/629-7044\\n',\n",

Why should every organ in the body suddenly\\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\\nstory here.\\n\\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\\n\\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim\\'s body fluids\\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim\\'s weight will increase by\\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.
